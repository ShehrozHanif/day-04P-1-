# File 1: UserContext.ts

This file sets up the foundation for our UserContext — like creating a blueprint for managing user data and errors in our app.


---

Code Breakdown and Explanation

"use client"

## Explanation: 
This line tells Next.js that this code should only run on the client side (the browser).

### import React, { createContext } from "react";

## Explanation:
This imports createContext from React, a function that helps us create a new context for managing and sharing data globally across components.


export interface User {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}

## Explanation: 
Here, we’re defining a User interface to specify the data we want to store about a user. This structure includes username and password.


interface UserContextType {
  user: User | null;
  setUser: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<User | null>>;
  error: string | null;
  setError: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string | null>>;
}

## Explanation: 
This defines the UserContextType interface, which outlines what data and functions our context will provide:

user: Holds the user's info or null (if no user is logged in).

setUser: Function to update user.

error: Holds any error message.

setError: Function to update error.


const userContext = createContext<UserContextType | undefined>(undefined);

## Explanation: 
This line creates the actual context (userContext) using createContext, with a default value of undefined (no user data initially).


export default userContext;

## Explanation: 
This line allows other files in your project to import userContext and use it.






# File 2: UserContextProvider.tsx

This file sets up the UserContextProvider component. It manages the actual user data and error messages and provides them to child components that need it.


---

Code Breakdown and Explanation

"use client"

## Explanation: 
This line, just like in the previous file, specifies that this component will run on the client side.


import React, { ReactNode, useState } from "react";
import userContext, { User } from "./UserContext";

## Explanation: 
Here, we’re importing userContext and User from UserContext.ts. We’re also importing useState to help manage the user data and error messages.


interface UserProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

## Explanation: 
UserProviderProps is an interface that defines the props that UserContextProvider will accept. children: ReactNode means that this component can wrap other components.

const UserContextProvider: React.FC<UserProviderProps> = ({ children }) => {

## Explanation: 
This line defines the UserContextProvider component as a React functional component that accepts UserProviderProps.


const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

## Explanation: 
These two lines define the user and error state variables:

user is initially set to null, meaning no user is logged in.

error is initially null, meaning there’s no error message.

return (
    <userContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser, error, setError }}>
      {children}
    </userContext.Provider>
  );

## Explanation:

<userContext.Provider> wraps the children (other components) in this provider, allowing them to access user, setUser, error, and setError.

value={{ user, setUser, error, setError }} specifies what data and functions this provider is sharing.


export default UserContextProvider;

Explanation: This line exports UserContextProvider, making it available for use in other parts of the app.


# Summary

UserContext.ts sets up the intercom system by defining the user data structure and creating the context (like turning on the intercom).

UserContextProvider.tsx manages the actual user data and error messages, allowing any component wrapped by UserContextProvider to access these details.


This setup means that if a user logs in, any part of the app (like the profile page or checkout page) can immediately access the updated user data without needing it passed through props. Similarly, if there’s a login error, any part of the app can respond to it automatically.



# Login.tsx

This Login component allows a user to enter their username and password to log in. It handles the form submission, validates input, and displays error messages if needed. Let’s go through it line-by-line with simple explanations and real-world analogies.


---

File: Login.tsx

This component is responsible for rendering the login form and interacting with UserContext to manage user data and errors.


---

Code Breakdown and Explanation

"use client"

Explanation: This ensures the component only runs on the client side.

Analogy: Since logging in is something a user does on their device (client side), this specifies that this functionality shouldn’t run on the server.



---

import userContext from "../context/UserContext";
import { useState, useContext } from "react";
import React from "react";

Explanation: Here, we’re importing userContext so we can access shared user data and error handling. We also import useState (for managing form input) and useContext (to access data from userContext).

Analogy: This is like connecting to the library’s intercom system so we can interact with user data and any errors. The useState hook will help us manage the text inputs for the username and password fields.



---

function Login() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const { setUser, setError, error } = useContext(userContext) || {};

Explanation:

username and password are initialized as empty strings. These will store the user's input from the login form.

useContext(userContext) gives us access to setUser, setError, and error from UserContext.


Analogy: Think of username and password as blanks on a registration form that the user needs to fill out. By calling useContext(userContext), we’re connecting to the library’s main reception desk, where we can update the logged-in user or log any errors.



---

const handleSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();

Explanation: This defines handleSubmit, a function that runs when the form is submitted. e.preventDefault() prevents the page from reloading, allowing us to handle the form data ourselves.

Analogy: This is like handling a paper form submission at the library. Instead of sending the form off immediately, we check it ourselves before processing.



---

if (!username || !password) {
      setError && setError("Please enter both username and password.");
      setUser && setUser(null); // Clear previous user data if there’s an error
    } else {
      setUser && setUser({ username, password });
      setError && setError(null); // Clear error if login is successful
    }

Explanation:

If username or password is empty, we use setError to show an error message ("Please enter both username and password").

We also use setUser(null) to clear any previous user data.

Otherwise (if both fields have values), setUser({ username, password }) stores the entered username and password in UserContext, and setError(null) clears any previous errors.


Analogy:

If the user leaves any fields empty, this is like the receptionist saying, “Please fill in all fields.”

If all information is filled, the receptionist logs them in by storing their details (username and password) and clears any previous warning.




---

};

Explanation: This closes the handleSubmit function.



---

return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-96 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg w-full max-w-sm">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center text-gray-700 mb-6">Login</h2>

Explanation: This code returns JSX that defines the layout of the login form.

The outer div centers the form vertically and horizontally on the page.

The inner div adds styling for the form’s background, padding, shadow, and size.

The <h2> tag displays a "Login" title at the top.


Analogy: Imagine setting up a welcome desk at the library entrance. You decorate it with colors and a clear title, making it inviting and visually distinct for users.



---

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="space-y-4">
          <input
            type="text"
            value={username}
            onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
            placeholder="Username"
            className="w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-md text-gray-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
          />
          <input
            type="password"
            value={password}
            onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
            placeholder="Password"
            className="w-full px-4 py-2 border rounded-md text-gray-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
          />
          <button
            type="submit"
            className="w-full py-2 mt-4 bg-blue-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-md hover:bg-blue-600 transition duration-300"
          >
            Submit
          </button>
        </form>

Explanation:

<form>: Handles the onSubmit event, triggering handleSubmit.

<input type="text">: Displays a text field for the username. value={username} and onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} ensure the field is updated as the user types.

<input type="password">: Displays a password field that works similarly to the username field.

<button type="submit">: This is the submit button. When clicked, it triggers handleSubmit.

Styling adds padding, borders, colors, and rounded corners to make the form user-friendly.


Analogy:

The form itself is like a registration sheet.

The username and password fields are where users enter their details.

The submit button is what the user clicks to log in. It’s like handing the form to the receptionist, who then checks the details (using handleSubmit).




---

{error && (
          <p className="text-red-500 text-center mt-4">{error}</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );

Explanation: This renders an error message if error is set in UserContext. If there’s an error, it displays the message in red text below the form.

Analogy: If there’s an issue with the user’s information (like a missing password), the receptionist (the app) displays an error message in a visible spot to let the user know what needs fixing.



---

export default Login;

Explanation: This line makes Login available to be imported in other files.

Analogy: This is like making the login desk accessible so other parts of the library (app) can direct users here when they need to log in.



---

# Summary

In short, this component handles the user login process:

1. It displays input fields for username and password.


2. It validates the inputs when the user submits the form.


3. It sets an error message if fields are empty, or updates UserContext with the user data if both fields are filled.


4. Any component in the app that uses UserContext can now access the logged-in user data or error messages.





# Profile.tsx 
The Profile component displays a user’s information if they’re logged in, and shows an error message or a “No user logged in” message otherwise. Let’s break down each part of the code with simple explanations and a real-world scenario analogy.


---

File: Profile.tsx

This component renders a profile view that shows either the user’s information (like their username) if they’re logged in, or an error message if something went wrong.


---

Code Breakdown and Explanation

"use client"

Explanation: Ensures the component runs on the client side.

Analogy: In a library, this is like saying that a user profile display should only be set up at the user’s personal desk, not the main library office.



---

import userContext from "../context/UserContext";
import { useContext } from "react";
import React from "react";

Explanation: We import userContext to access shared user data and any error messages. useContext lets us retrieve these values from UserContext.

Analogy: This is like connecting to the library’s record system so that we can access and display the specific information of the logged-in user.



---

function Profile() {
  const { user, error } = useContext(userContext) || {};

Explanation:

useContext(userContext) gives us access to user and error from UserContext.

By writing useContext(userContext) || {}, we ensure user and error won’t cause errors even if userContext isn’t available.


Analogy: Imagine checking the library’s system to see if a user is logged in. If no user is found, it would be like the library not having a record for that user.



---

return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-96 bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-blue-500">
      <div className="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg w-full max-w-md">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center text-gray-700 mb-6">Profile</h2>

Explanation:

This code starts the layout of the profile page.

The outer div centers the profile card on the page with a gradient background.

The inner div styles the profile card with padding, shadow, and a rounded design.

The <h2> tag displays the "Profile" title.


Analogy: This is like setting up a profile area at the user’s desk with attractive decorations and a title, making it clear that this area shows user information.



---

{error && (
          <p className="text-red-500 text-center mb-4">
            {error}
          </p>
        )}

Explanation:

This checks if there’s an error from UserContext. If there is, it displays the error message in red text.


Analogy: If there was an issue with the user’s login (like missing credentials), this is like the library’s receptionist saying, “There was a problem with your account,” and displaying the message visibly for the user to see.



---

{user ? (
          <div className="text-center">
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg font-semibold">
              Welcome 😊 <br /> <span className="font-normal">{user.username}</span>
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg font-semibold mt-2">
              {/* Password: <span className="font-normal">{user.password}</span> */}
            </p>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-center mt-4">
            No user logged in
          </p>
        )}

Explanation:

If user exists (meaning someone is logged in), it displays a welcome message along with the user’s username.

If the user is not logged in (user is null), it shows “No user logged in.”

Note that the password line is commented out. If uncommented, it would display the password as well (but this is typically hidden for security).


Analogy:

When the user is logged in, it’s like displaying their profile details at their desk. The welcome message is like a personal greeting.

If the user is not logged in, it’s like displaying a notice that no user is logged in.




---

</div>
    </div>
  );
}

Explanation: This closes the profile card and page layout.



---

export default Profile;

Explanation: This line makes the Profile component available for use in other parts of the app.

Analogy: This is like adding a sign on the profile desk so other parts of the library (app) can direct users here when they want to view their profile.



---

# Summary

This Profile component displays either:

1. A welcome message and the user’s username if they’re logged in.


2. An error message if there’s an issue (e.g., missing credentials).


3. A "No user logged in" message if no one is logged in.



This setup ensures the user knows if they’re logged in and if there’s an issue with their login attempt. The Profile component gives quick and helpful feedback, just like a receptionist might at a library desk.



# App.tsx

Let's go through this App component step-by-step to understand its structure and purpose, especially how it uses the UserContextProvider to make context data available to other components. This example will help make it clear why and how Context is being used in this component structure.


---

Code Breakdown

import Login from "../components/Login";
import Profile from "../components/Profile";
import UserContextProvider from "../context/UserContextProvider";
import React from "react";

1. Importing Components and Context Provider

import Login from "../components/Login";

This imports the Login component, where users can enter their username and password to log in.


import Profile from "../components/Profile";

This imports the Profile component, where users can see their profile information once they are logged in.


import UserContextProvider from "../context/UserContextProvider";

This imports the UserContextProvider component, which wraps other components and provides them with access to the user context.




---

function App() {
  return (
    <UserContextProvider>
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center">React with Context API Example</h1>
      <Login />
      <Profile />
    </UserContextProvider>
  );
}

2. Defining the App Component

function App() { ... }

This is the main component that combines everything together. It will be rendered at the root of the application.




---

3. Using UserContextProvider to Wrap Components

<UserContextProvider> ... </UserContextProvider>

UserContextProvider wraps around the components that need access to the userContext.

It provides values like user, error, and the setter functions (setUser and setError) so that Login and Profile can access and modify these values.


Real-World Analogy: Think of UserContextProvider as a backstage pass. It gives both Login and Profile special access to shared information about the user’s login status. Without this pass, these components would be isolated and unable to share user data with each other.



---

4. <h1> Header Element

<h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center">React with Context API Example</h1>

This is a simple header displaying the title of the application.

The className styling makes it large, bold, and centered. This is purely for presentation and does not affect the logic or data flow.




---

5. Rendering Login and Profile Components

<Login /> and <Profile />

These two components are rendered within UserContextProvider.

Login will allow the user to enter login details. It can set the user information and handle any errors.

Profile displays the user’s profile information if they are logged in or shows a message if no user is logged in.



Since Login and Profile are wrapped by UserContextProvider, they have access to shared data about the user and can update or display this information without needing to pass it through props.


---

# Summary and Real-World Scenario

This setup lets us build an app with global access to user data using the Context API, so components like Login and Profile can communicate about the user without being directly connected. This structure is helpful when:

You have a login and profile system: Users log in through Login, and once logged in, their details can be displayed in Profile.

No need for prop drilling: Login and Profile share user data without passing it from App down through each component. UserContextProvider ensures both components access the context directly.



---

In short, App is the main component that organizes the application, and UserContextProvider is the tool that connects the Login and Profile components to shared user data in a smooth and structured way. This approach keeps code cleaner and avoids passing data manually through multiple levels of components.
